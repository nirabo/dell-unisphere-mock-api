# **Unisphere Management REST** API **Reference Guide**

The Unisphere Management REST API lets you manage Unisphere through web browsers.and application programs. This API conforms to Representational State Transfer (REST) design principles, which is a frequent choice for many webbased APIs. In a REST API, each resource type (object) has a unique Universal Resource Identifier (URI), and each resource instance has a unique identifier. You interact with the resources exposed by the API by accessing resources using HTTP GET, POST, and DELETE requests. The server sends response data in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

The Unisphere Management REST API is compliant with the EMC Data Access API (EDAA) style, which follows REST industry best practices. Once you are familiar with one Dell EDAA-compliant REST API, you can easily learn to use the other Dell EDAA-compliant REST APIs.

This online Help system describes the resource types, methods, and attributes in the Unisphere Management REST API, along with other API information such as data types and enumerations. The tree on the left lets you access the Help topics for individual resoure types by category or alphabetically.

- To access the the Help topic for a resource type by category, expand the **Resource types** by **category** node, expand the category for which you want to view resource types, and double-click on the desired Help topic.
- To access the Help topic for a resource type alphabetically, expand the **Alphabetical list** of all **resources** node, navigate to the Help topic you want to view, and double click on it.

# QuotaPolicyEnum

A quota policy value represents a policy how drive usage (used by a user or within a quota tree) is calculated.

|
|  |

| 1 | Blocks | Calculates drive usage in terms of file system blocks (8 KB |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | units) and the usage of all files including directories and |
|  |  | symbolic links. With this policy, any operation resulting in |
|  |  | allocation of blocks or removal of blocks such as creating. |
|  |  | expanding, or deleting a directory; writing or deleting files; or |
|  |  | creating or deleting symbolic links changes block usage. |
|  |  | Note: When using the blocks policy, the user can create a |
|  |  | sparse file whose size is large (more than the limit), but that |
|  |  | actually uses few blocks on the drive. |
| 0 | File Size | Calculates drive usage only in terms of logical file sizes, |
|  |  | ignoring directory sizes and symbolic links. Use this policy |
|  |  | where file sizes are critical to quotas, such as where user |
|  |  | usage is based on the size of the files created, and where |
|  |  | sizes or their sum exceeding the limit is unacceptable. This |
|  |  | policy is recommended in CIFS environments. With this policy |
|  |  | , block usage depends solely on the number of bytes added to |
|  |  | or removed from the file. Usage depends only on changes to a |
|  |  | regular file. Directories and symbolic links are not considered. |

### QuotaStateEnum

A QuotaStateEnum value represents a state of the quota record (either user quota or tree quota) period.

| Value | Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | OK | No quota limits are exceeded. |
|  | Soft Exceeded | Soft limit is exceeded, and grace period is not expired yet. |
| 2 | Soft_Exceeded_And_Expired | Soft limit is exceeded, and grace period is expired. |
| 3 | Hard Exceeded | Hard limit is exceeded. |
| 4 | Unlimited | Grace Period Unlimited. |

| Value | Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | None | None. |
| 1 | RAID5 | RAID 5 has one parity disk. It provides best performance and |
|  |  | space efficiency. RAID 5 groups provide protection for single |
|  |  | disk faults and RAID5 is vulnerable to double disk fault. The |
|  |  | preferred stripe width configurations are 4+1 and 8+1. |

|  |  | used. RAID 0 is not used in the storage system. |
| 3 | RAID1 | RAID 1 provides mirroring protection. RAID 1 is used only to |
|  |  | create RAID groups for FAST Cache. |
| 4 | RAID3 | RAID 3 is not used in the storage system. |
| 7 | RAID10 | RAID 1/0 is mixture of striping and mirroring. It has a number |
|  |  | of parity disks equal to half of the disks in the RAID group. The |
|  |  | best for heavy transactional workloads with random writes. |
|  |  | The preferred stripe width configuration is 4+4. |
| 10 | RAID6 | RAID 6 uses two disks for parity, it's mostly used with NL-SAS |
|  |  | disks and read intensive workloads, for archives and backups. |
|  |  | Two disks in the RAID group may fail simultaneously without |
|  |  | data loss. The preferred stripe width configurations are 8+2 |
|  |  | and 14+2. |
| 12 | Mixed | (Applies to pool objects only.) Indicates that RAID groups in a |
|  |  | pool have different RAID levels. Do not use this value in |
|  |  | Create or Modify requests. |
| 48,879 | Automatic | Automatic is a valid value for create/modify requests. |
|  |  | Indicates that the default RAID level will be used in pool's |
|  |  | Create and Modify requests for the specified TierType. E.g. for |
|  |  | SAS disk type (performance tier) RAID5, for NL-SAS disk type |

# **dnsServer**

#### Domain Name System (DNS) settings.

A Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system responsible for converting domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The system uses DNS services to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.

During the initial system configuration process you must specify the network address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses. Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.

You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP address of the DNS servers for the system to use. By default, the system uses the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the system proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the system will use first.

DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is identified by a domain identifier.

**Important:** You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in the domain for the system. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt communication between the system and the hosts that use its storage resources.

# **fileNDMPServer**

The NDMP server for the NAS Server. You can configure one NDMP server per NAS server.

The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) provides a standard for backing up file servers on a network. NDMP allows centralized applications to back up file servers that run on various platforms and platform versions. NDMP reduces network congestion by isolating control path traffic from data path traffic, which permits centrally managed and monitored local backup operations. Storage systems support NDMP v2-v4 over the network. Direct-attach NDMP is not supported. This means that the tape drives need to be connected to a media server, and the NAS server communicates with the media server over the network. NDMP has an advantage when using multiprotocol file systems because it backs up the Windows ACLs as well as the UNIX security information.

Note: If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port, configure them before creating an FSN

Note: You can aggregate only Ethernet Ports and link aggregations with the same MTU size and not included in another FSN Port

Note: You can not add an Ethernet Port to FSN if there are iSCSI portals on it

The features of an ESN Port are as follows:

- FSN component devices do not have to be the same device type. A single FSN Port can include Fast Ethenet devices or link aggregations, or a combination of these types, all
- There can be a maximum of four devices in a FSN.
- Only one component device of an ESN Port is active at a time
- If all the connections in FSN Port fail, the link is down.

### **ftpServer**

Information about the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) servers of a NAS server.

You can configure one FTP server and one SFTP server per NAS server. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. For secure transmission that encrypts the username, password, and content, FTP is secured with SSH (SFTP).

You can activate an FTP server and SFTP server independently on each NAS server. The FTP and SFTP clients are authenticated using credentials defined on a Unix name server (such as an NIS server or a LDAP server) or a Windows domain. Windows user names need to be entered using the 'username@domain' or 'domain\\username' formats. Each FTP and SFTP must have a home directory defined in the name server that must be accessible on the NAS server. FTP allows also clients to connect as anonymous users.

### **Supported operations**

Collection query , Instance query ,Create ,Delete ,Modify

# **linkAggregation**

(Applies if link aggregation is supported.) Ethernet port link aggregation settings.

Link aggregation lets you link Ethernet ports (for example, port 0 and port 1) on a Storage Processor (SP) to a single logical port, and therefore lets you use up to four Ethernet ports on the SP. If your system has two SPs, and you link two physical ports, the same ports on both SPs are linked for redundancy. For example, if you link port 0 to port 1, the system creates one link aggregation for these ports on SPA and another link aggregation on SPB.

**Note:** You can aggregate only Ethernet ports belonging to the same I/O module or on-board Ethernet ports. Aggregation of ports from different I/O modules is not allowed.

**Note:** You can aggregate only Ethernet ports with the same MTU size.

**Note:** You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.

Link aggregation provides the following advantages:

Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one logical port.

Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.

Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the system does not lose connectivity.

**Note:** With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came with your switch should provide more information about using LACP.

The Unisphere online Help provides more details on cabling the SPs to the Disk-Array Enclosures (DAEs).

#### **nasServer**

Information about the NAS server in the storage system.

NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports for hosts to access file-level storage resources. NAS servers are independent from each other.

NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP). Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems.

Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB. In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group. Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to the other SP when there is an SP failure event.

### **preferredInterfaceSettings**

The preferred interface of NAS server is an interface from which all the non-local outbound connections of this NAS server are initiated. The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway).

The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:

- 1. Production interfaces, IPv4.
- 2. Production interfaces, IPv6.
- 3. Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.
- 4. Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.

Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.

The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):

- 1. Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.
- 2. Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.
- 3. The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.
- 4. From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.
- 5. From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.

**Note:** During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.

For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed. If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting (e.g. "Production/IPv6") gets reset to automatic selection.

During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden. It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from the "override" flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden, the interface is kept preferred.

The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, fileInterface.isPreferred == true. To get the list of the acting preferred interfaces of a NAS server, iterate its interface list checking the isPreferred property.

#### **Modify operation**

Modify Preferred Interface Settings.

To set a type/class group to automatic selection, unset the corresponding parameter.

On the destination side of the active replication session:

To override the production preferred interface settings, set any of the production settings to any value, including the same it has now.

Setting the replicationPolicy to "Overridden" makes the production preferred interface settings overridden w/o changing their current values.

To reset the overridden settings to the replicated state, set the replicationPolicy to "Replicated". Without the active replication session or on the source side of such session:

Setting the replicationPolicy to any value results in error.

The full logics of these settings is described in the class description above.

### **route**

Manages static IP routes, including creating, modifying, and deleting these routes.

A route determines where to send a packet next so it can reach its final destination. A static route is set explicitly and does not automatically adapt to the changing network infrastructure. A route is defined by an interface, destination IP address range and an IP address of a corresponding gateway.

**Note:** IP routes connect an interface (IP address) to the larger network through gateways. Without routes, the interface is no longer accessible outside of its immediate subnet. As a result, network shares and exports associated with the interface are no longer available to clients outside their immediate subnet.

Routes can be created only for iSCSI portals.

Information about host initiators in the storage system.

After you create a host configuration for controlling host access to storage on the system, you need to create a host initiator for each host configuration that accesses iSCSI or Fibre Channel (FC) storage. The initiator connects the host to the target iSCSI or FC node on the system.

Initiator-based registration allows you to register the initiator to a host without having to manage individual paths. By default, when an initiator is registered to a host, all of its paths, including those specified after the registration takes place, are automatically granted access to any storage provisioned for the host.

|  |  | Before you can create additional shares within an NFS |
|  |  | shared folder, you must create directories within it from a |

## **rpChapSettings**

CHAP accounts management for RPA cluster. RPA iSCSI ports act as initiators and log into storage targets, meanwhile, storage iSCSI ports act as initiators and log into RPA targets as well. For security reason, forward CHAP is supported on both directions. Outgoing forward CHAP account is used by storage ports to log into RPAs and incoming foward CHAP account is used by storage to authenticate RPA initiators. However, for now incoming forward account is managed by iscsiSettings and it will be moved here in later releases.

Once ASA is enabled on the NAS server, Dell's VSI Unified Storage Management tool can be utilized for the following:

Simplifying the process of creating NFS datastores,

- Compressing virtual machines in NFS datastores,
- Reducing the amount of storage consumed by virtual machines by using data reduction and Fast Clone technologies. The cloning functions include fast clones (thin copy/snaps) of Virtual Machine Disk (VMDF) files and full clones (full copy) of Virtual Machine Disk (VMDF) files.

# **fastVP**

System FAST VP settings. FAST VP allows performing automatic data relocation between tiers and rebalancing within a tier to improve storage performance. Currently there three types of relocations supported:

- Scheduled relocations
- Manual relocations
- Rebalancing

Scheduled relocations are started according the schedule defined in this resource. Individual pools can be included to or excluded from the scheduled relocation process. Manual relocations can be performed on demand for each particular pool.

Rebalancing is performed automatically on a pool extend event.

The FAST VP object represents the status of scheduled relocation processes and allows to view or modify the scheduled relocation parameters. It also provides a means to pause or resume all the FAST VP relocation and rebalancing processes currently running on the system.

### **fileEventsPublisher**

File Event Service is a mechanism whereby applications can register to receive event notification and context from sources such as VNX(e). File Event Service is a part of VNX Event Enabler Framework (VEE). VEE provides the working environment for the CAVA and CEPA (Common Event Publishing Agent) facilities. The event publishing agent delivers to the application both event notification and associated context in one message. Context may consist of file metadata or directory metadata needed to decide business policy. The CEPA sub-facilities include: - Auditing.A mechanism for delivering post-events to registered consumer applications in a synchronous manner. Events are delivered individually in realtime. - CQM.A mechanism for delivering pre-events to registered consumer applications in a synchronous manner. Events are delivered individually in real-time, allowing the consumer application to exercise business policy on the event. - VCAPS.A mechanism for delivering post-events in asynchronous mode. The delivery cadence is based on a time period or a number of events. - MessageExchange.A mechanism for delivering post-events in asynchronous mode, when needed, without consumer use of the CEPA API. Events are published from CEPA to the RabbitMQ CEE_Events exchange. A consumer application creates a queue for itself in the exchange from which it can retrieve events.

### **moveSession**

## Information about movesession.

A customer environment is often ever-changing, and as a result the ability to deliver business continuity and flexibility is paramount. The new local LUN migration feature address this concern, by adding the ability to move LUNs and Consistency Groups between Pools on a system. Local LUN migration can be used to rebalance storage resources across Pools when customer activity changes and an individual Pool's usage becomes oversaturated. Another use case for local LUN migration is to provide LUNs with a destination when aPool is to be decommissioned. By leveraging Unity's Transparent Data Transfer (TDX) engine, host access remains fully online during the migration session.

# **pool**

#### Information about pools in the storage system.

**Creating pools using Quick Start mode**

You can use Quick Start mode to create system recommended pools based on the type and availability of drives in the system. In Quick Start mode, the system recommends separate pools for different drive types and uses default RAID configurations for the drives. A pool configured in Quick Start mode has only one tier.

Quick Start mode is available when both of these conditions are met:

No pools exist on the system.

The system is not licensed for FAST VP or FAST Cache.

To create pools using Quick Start mode, follow these steps:

- 1. Run POST api/types/pool/action/recommendAutoConfiguration.
The response body contains a set of poolSetting instances.

2. For each poolSetting instance returned in Step 1, run POST /api/types/pool/instances with the following arguments, using values obtained from the poolSetting instance:

addRaidGroupParameters : [{dskGroup : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.diskGroup,

numDisks : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.diskCount,

- raidType : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.raidType,
stripeWidth : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.stripeWidths},...]

Pool creation examples: Simple pool with one RAID5 4+1: POST /api/types/pool/instances {"name" : "PerformancePool", "addRaidGroupParameters" : [ {"dskGroup" : {"id" : dg_15}, "numDisks" : 6, "raidType" : 1, "stripeWidth" : 5} ] }

## Pool with raid group RAID10 1+1:

{"name" : "SysDefPool00", "description" : "The pool is created with RAID10(1+1)", "addRaidGroupParameters" : [ {"dskGroup" : {"id" : "dg_16"}, "numDisks" : 5, "raidType" : 7, "stripeWidth" : 2} ] }

#### **Embedded resource types**

#### Information about storage resources in the storage system.

A storage resource is a specific type of storage entity allocated in the storage system for a particular kind of host or application. The storage system provides the following types of storage resources:

- LUNs
- Consistency groups
- File systems accessed via NFS and/or CIFS shares.
- VMware NFS datastores
- VMware VMFS datastores
- VVol (file)
- VVol (block)
- All types of storage resource types can be divided into two major groups:
- Block (or LUN based) storage resources: LUNs, consistency groups, VMware VMFS datastores, VVol (block).
- File system based storage resources: File systems, VMware NFS datastores, VVol (file).

In order to create a storage resource, there must be at least one pool configured on the system. For information about configuring pools, see the help topic for the pool. To provision file system based storage resource there must be at least one nasServer configured on the system.

### Attributes for cifsShareCreate

(Applies to SMB (also known as CIFS) file shares.) Parameters used for creating a CIFS share when creating or modifying a file system.

This resource type is embedded in the storageBesource resource type

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | String[1.. 1023] | Local path to a location within a file system. |
|  |  | By default, the system creates a share to the root of the file |
|  |  | system (top-most directory) at file system creation time. This |
|  |  | path specifies the unique location of the file system on the |
|  |  | storage system. CIFS shares allow you to create multiple |
|  |  | network shares with the same local path. You can specify |
|  |  | different host-side access controls for different users, while |
|  |  | setting up network shares within the file system to access |
|  |  | common content. |
|  |  | If you want the CIFS network shares within the same file system |
|  |  | to access different content, you must first create a share to the |
|  |  | root of the file system. Then, you can connect from a Windows |
|  |  | host, create additional directories from Windows, and create |
|  |  | corresponding network shares using the REST API, Unisphere |
|  |  | GUI, or Unisphere CLI. |
| name | String[1.80] | Name of the CIFS share unique to NAS server. |

|  |  | from compression, deduplication and advanced |

|  |  | deduplication) in the pools on the storage system. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dataReductionPercent | unsigned Integer[32(percent)] | Data reduction applied increase of storage space expressed |
|  |  | as percentage of summary of used and data reduction saved |
|  |  | space size (includes space saved from compression and |
|  |  | deduplication). |
| dataReductionRatio | Float[64] | Storage efficiency ratio of applying data reduction on the |
|  |  | system, calculated according to the data reduction savings |
|  |  | (includes savings from compression and deduplication) for |

|  |  | provisioned size of all primary storage resources) / (Total |
|  |  | allocated size of all primary storage resources without |
|  |  | including data reduction savings, if any). Because savings |

### **ntpServer**

Network Time Protocol (NTP) server settings.

The system relies on NTP as a standard for synchronizing the system clock with other nodes on the network. NTP provides a way of synchronizing clocks of distributed systems within approximately one millisecond of each other. A Windows Active Directory domain controller can operate as a time server if the Windows Time Service is running on it.

Some applications will not operate correctly if the clock on the system is not synchronized with the clock on connected hosts. Configure the system and any connected hosts to use the same time server. Doing so does the following:

Minimizes the chance that synchronization issues will arise between the system and connected hosts.

Reduces the difficulty of reconciling timestamps used for log information in the different systems.

**Note:** When using a NAS server for CIFS network shares, the system cannot access an Active Directory domain unless the system is synchronized within five minutes of the Active Directory controller for the domain where the network shares reside.

You can configure a total of four NTP server addresses for the system. All NTP server addresses are grouped into a single NTP server record.

|  |  |  |  | OVMS device UUID must also be consistent for any |
|  |  |  |  | given device across all nodes of an OVMS cluster. |
|  |  |  |  | Dell VNX and Unity systems create the OVMS |

|  |  |  |  | configured with unique values which avoid |
|  |  |  |  | conflicting OVMS device UUIDs. Unity and VNX |
|  |  |  |  | devices connected to multi-node OVMS clusters |
|  |  |  |  | should be configured into a consistency group to |

### **Protecting data**

| ldapServer |
| --- |

Information about the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server used by the storage system as an authentication authority for administrative users. You can configure one LDAP server. The system uses the LDAP settings for facilitating access control to Unisphere and the Unisphere CLI, but not for facilitating access control to storage resources.

LDAP is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running on TCP/IP networks. LDAP provides central management for network authentication and authorization operations by helping to centralize user and group management across the network. Integrating the system into an existing LDAP environment provides a way to control user and user group access to the system through Unisphere or the Unisphere CLI.

After you configure LDAP settings for the system, you can manage users and user groups within the context of an established LDAP directory structure. For example, you can assign access permissions to the Unisphere CLI that are based on existing users and groups.

## **replicationSession**

Information about replication sessions.

Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either locally or to a remote network device. Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:

Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.

Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.

A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a replication operation between a source and a destination. The replication source and destination may be local or remote. The session establishes the path that the data follows as it moves from source to destination.

|  |  |  |  | it is replicated from the inbound async |
|  |  |  |  | replication session. |

# **Delete operation**

Delete a replication session. This can be applied in any operational state of the session.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | DELETE /api/instances/replicationSession/<id> |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance to delete. |
|  | Or |
|  | DELETE /api/instances/replicationSession/name:<value> |

| Request body arguments | None |
| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

### **Precheck operation**

Precheck the replication session. Check for a common base snap of a sync replication session, and if it is a NAS Server session, also check each includedfilesystem replication session for a common base snap. A common base snap is identified by the corresponding source and destination snap ids for the replicated common base snap. The result will include each common base snap found, which may be an empty list.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| precheckOutput | out | List<commonBaseSnap> | N/A | The result of the precheck. |

## **Resume operation**

Resume a replication session. This can be applied on a replication session when it's operational status is reported as either Failed over or Paused. The allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy option is needed when a replication session goes out of sync due to a fault. Both allowFullCopy and forceFullCopy cannot be set simultaneously. If the session has no common base snapshot and neither allowFullCopy nor forceFullCopy is specified, a full copy will be performed using the same behavior as when allowFullCopy is set to true for a synchronous file replication. For NAS Server synchronous replication, if allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy is specified as false, the operation will fail since NAS Server synchronous replication has never had a common base snapshot.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/resume |

|  |  |  |  | interface for the source SPA. |
| srcSPBInterface | in | remoteInterface | Optional | (Applies to remote replication) Replication |
|  |  |  |  | interface for the source SPB. |
| dstSPAInterface | in | remoteInterface | Optional | (Applies to remote replication) Replication |
|  |  |  |  | interface for the destination SPA. |
| dstSPBInterface | in | remoteInterface | Optional | (Applies to remote replication) Replication |
|  |  |  |  | interface for the destination SPB. |
| forceFullCopy | in | Boolean | Optional | Indicates whether to force replicating all data |
|  |  |  |  | from the source to the destination during the |
|  |  |  |  | replication session resuming. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Replicate all data. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Replicate changed data only. |
| forceDiscardDestinationChanges | in | Boolean | Optional | Normally an asynchronous replication |
|  |  |  |  | session cannot be resumed when the |
|  |  |  |  | destination is or has been mounted R/W and |
|  |  |  |  | may have data written locally. The |
|  |  |  |  | forceDiscardDestinationChanges option |
|  |  |  |  | allows resume to proceed. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Resync the destination from the |
|  |  |  |  | source, overwriting any data written to |
|  |  |  |  | the destination while the replication was |
|  |  |  |  | not active. |
|  |  |  |  | false - The resume command will fail if |
|  |  |  |  | the destination is R/W and may have |
|  |  |  |  | data written locally. |

#### **Pause operation**

Pause a replication session. This can be applied to replication session when in OK state.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/pause |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |
|  | Or |
|  | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/name:<value>/action/pause |
|  | where <value> is the name of the replicationSession instance. |
| Request body arguments | None |
| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

#### **Sync operation**

Sync a replication session. This operation can be applied to initiate a sync on demand independent of type of session - auto or manual sync.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/sync |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |

| Request body arguments | None |
| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

### **Failover operation**

Fail over a replication session. Note that if a failover occurs and data is written to the new source (original destination), new snaps are taken, and finally a failback occurs: then those snaps will get replicated to the new destination (original source). However, we maintain the local retention for the original source and the remote retention for the original destination. If the same scenario occurs but a resume is requested instead of failback (essentially switching the replication direction), then the local and remote retentions are switched so that the local retention policy is applied on the new source and the remote policy is applied on the new destination.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/failover |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |
|  | Or |
|  | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/name:<value>/action/failover |
|  | where <value> is the name of the replicationSession instance. |
| Request body arguments | See the arguments table below. |

| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| --- | --- |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

|  |  |  |  | failing over the asynchronous replication session or whether to keep them |
|  |  |  |  | in sync after failing over the synchronous replication session. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Sync before failing over the asynchronous replication session or |
|  |  |  |  | keep in sync after failing over the synchronous replication session. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Do not sync before failing over the asynchronous replication |
|  |  |  |  | session or do not keep in sync after failing over the synchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication session. |
| force | in | Boolean | Optional | Indicates to skip pre-checks on file system(s) replication sessions of a NAS |
|  |  |  |  | server when a replication failover is issued from the source NAS server. |
|  |  |  |  | true - skip pre-check. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Do not skip pre-check. |

### **Failback operation**

Fail back a replication session. This can be applied on a replication session that is failed over. Fail back will synchronize the changes done to the original destination back to original source site and will restore the original direction of session. The allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy option is needed when a replication session goes out of sync due to a fault. Both allowFullCopy and forceFullCopy cannot be set simultaneously. If the session has no common base snapshot and neither allowFullCopy nor forceFullCopy is specified, a full copy will be performed using the same behavior as when allowFullCopy is set to true for a synchronous file replication. For NAS Server synchronous replication, if allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy is specified as false, the operation will fail since NAS Server synchronous replication has never had a common base snapshot.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/failback |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |

|  |  |  |  | false - Sync back changed |
|  |  |  |  | data only. |
| force | in | Boolean | Optional | Normally a NAS server |
|  |  |  |  | synchronous replication session |
|  |  |  |  | cannot be failed back unless |
|  |  |  |  | associated asynchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication sessions are |
|  |  |  |  | preserved. The force option allows |
|  |  |  |  | failback to proceed without |
|  |  |  |  | preserving asynchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication sessions. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Allow failback without |
|  |  |  |  | preserving asynchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication sessions. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Do not allow failback |
|  |  |  |  | without preserving |
|  |  |  |  | asynchronous replication |
|  |  |  |  | sessions. |
| forceDatalossChoice | in | ReplicationFailbackForceDataLossChoiceEnum | Optional | Normally an asynchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication session cannot be |
|  |  |  |  | failed back if the destination is |
|  |  |  |  | ReadWrite or has data that was |
|  |  |  |  | written locally. In this case both |
|  |  |  |  | the source and destination may |
|  |  |  |  | have data newer than the |
|  |  |  |  | replication session stoppage. The |
|  |  |  |  | forceDatalossChoice option allows |
|  |  |  |  | a choice of whether to use the |
|  |  |  |  | source or destination data in this |
|  |  |  |  | case. |
|  |  |  |  | None - the failback operation |
|  |  |  |  | will fail if both source and |
|  |  |  |  | destination have been |
|  |  |  |  | mounted r/w since the |
|  |  |  |  | replication was stopped. |

| Discard_Destination_Changes | . | - the source will be synced to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the destination before failing | back. Any data written to the |  |
| destination since the | replication was stopped will be |  |
| lost. | Discard_Source_Changes - | . |
| the destination will be synced | to the source before failing |  |
| back. Any data written to the | source since the replication |  |
| was stopped will be lost. |  |  |

#### Preserve_async operation

 Unity Rennde Support is enabled with the Dell's eading rembe support (ESRS), ESRS is a renote nontioning and support (ESRS), ESRS is a renote monitioning and support reatur capabilities to storage systems via a secure and encrypted turnel. The secure tunnel fran ESRS-stablishes between the storage system and systems on the Dell network can be us Dell

ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end remote support solution

- Automation IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis and repair of potential problems before an impact to business operations is noticed.
- Authentication Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit encryption and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.
- Authorization Customizable policies that you control include the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions
- Audit Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory and internal business requirements

# ESRS offers two remote support solutions

- Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated into the storage system to connect with Dell .
- Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) to connect with Dell
- An installed Dell Support license
- Valid support credentials
- A configured DNS server

For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the support website.

Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the supportProxy object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### **Series operations need** to **perform** to **enable Integrated Remote Support**

```
Step 1: Accept EULA. The EULA must be accepted before any other configurations.
```
POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify { "isEsrsVeEulaAccepted" : "true" }

Step 2: Update contact infomation in systemInformation object. Dell will use this information to contact enduser when errors detected.

```
POST /api/instances/systemInformation/0/action/modify
{
  "contactFirstName" : "Jill",
  "contactLastName" : "Valentine",
  "contactCompany" : "Umbrella Corporation",
  "contactEmail" : "jill.valentine@umbrella.com",
  "contactPhone" : "111-111-1111"
```
#### Step 3: Set proxy server if the user wants to configure Integrated Remote Support with a proxy server. This step can be skipped if user doesn't want to use proxy server.

```
POST /api/instances/supportProxy/0/action/modify
{
  "isEnabled" : "true",
  "address" : "10.105.221.123:1080",
  "protocol" : "1",
  "username" : "darthv",
  "password" : "password"
}
```
#### Step 4: Validate Network connectivity between Integrated Remote Support client and Dell servers.

```
POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/checkNetwork
{
```
Following steps are try to get the available sites for the current system, select the correct one and set it into Integrated Remote Support client. Step 5: Request for an access code. This access code will be used later to get the available sites.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/requestAccessCode

#### Step 6: Validate the access code.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/validateAccessCode

"accessCode" : "243857"

#### Step 7: Set siteId. Select the correct site id from the returned sites in previous request.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify

"enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "false" }

Now, Integration Remote Support is enabled.

# **Disabling Integrated Remote Support**

If a proxy server or Policy Manager are enabled, they will automatically be disabled.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify {

"enabled" : "false", "isCentralized" : "false" }

**Checking** the **Integrated Remote Support status**

GET /api/types/esrsParam/instances?fields=enabled,isCentralized

"content": { "isCentralized" : "false", "status" : 2

}

#### **Checking** the **Integrated Remote Support configuration**

GET /api/types/esrsParam/instances?fields=enabled,isCentralized,status, statusDescription::@enum(status) Sample response: "content": { "enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "false", "status" : "2" "statusDescription" : "connected" } The statusDescription attribute is a calculated attribute that translates the normalized status value into a user friendly string.

#### **Enabling Centralized Remote Support**

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify { "enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "true", "esrsVeAddress" : "10.105.221.123" }

# **Modifying** the **Centralized Remote Support appliance**

This example disconnects the storage system from the current ESRS VE appliance and reconnects it to a new one.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify { "enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "true", "esrsVeAddress" : "myveserver.acme.com:2135" }

## **Disabling Centralized Remote Support**

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify { "enabled" : "false" "isCentralized" : "true",

#### **Switching between Integrated** and **Centralized Remote Support**

This example assumes that Integrated Remote Support is enabled. It will be disabled before the Centralized Remote Support is enabled.

## **securitySettings**

#### All the system level security settings.

Use this resource to enable and disable system level security settings. The settings include:

#### a) FIPS 140-2

are sufficiently strong.

Information about whether the system is working in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.

The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management communication into and out of the system is encrypted using SSL. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation to those that

If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

#### b) SSO

Information about whether the system is participating in Single Sign On mode.

In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication server for multiple storage system, thus creating a shared authentication domain where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering user credentials.

If SSO is enabled, the system will participate in Single Sign On mode, and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

#### c) TLS Mode

Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.

Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use. By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications. TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols. TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol. TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.

Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol. In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.

NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server.

# **cifsServer**

Information about SMB server of a NAS server. You can configure one SMB server per NAS server.

SMB, which stands for Server Message Block, is a protocol for sharing files and communications abstractions such as named pipes and mail slots between computers. Most usage of SMB involves computers running Microsoft Windows. Others vendors implementing SMB are Samba, MacOS.. SMB was also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS).

An SMB server is created each time Windows shares are enabled on the NAS server. An SMB server could be created as a standalone server or as a server that belongs to a Windows domain (Active Directory). In that case, DNS must be enabled on the NAS server. The credentials of an administrator of the domain are required to join that domain. An NTP server must be defined also, to prevent authentication errors caused by unsynchronized clocks.

### **cifsShare**

Information about Common Internet File System (CIFS) shares in the storage system.

CIFS shares use the CIFS protocol to provide an access point for configured Windows hosts to access file system storage. The system uses Active Directory to authenticate user and user group access to the share.

**Note:** To manage CIFS shares for snaps, use the operations for this resource type. To manage CIFS shares for file systems, use the applicable operations for the storageResource resource type, as described in the help topic for that resource type.

| path | in | String[1.. 1023] | Required | Local path to a location |
|  |  |  |  | within a file system. |
|  |  |  |  | By default, the system |
|  |  |  |  | creates a share to the root |
|  |  |  |  | of the file system (top-most |
|  |  |  |  | directory) at file system |
|  |  |  |  | creation time. This path specifies the unique location |
|  |  |  |  | of the file system on the |
|  |  |  |  | storage system. CIFS |
|  |  |  |  | shares allow you to create multiple network shares |
|  |  |  |  | with the same local path. |
|  |  |  |  | You can specify different |
|  |  |  |  | host-side access controls for |
|  |  |  |  | different users, while setting |
|  |  |  |  | up network shares within |
|  |  |  |  | the file system to access |
|  |  |  |  | common content. |
|  |  |  |  | If you want the CIFS |
|  |  |  |  | network shares within the |
|  |  |  |  | same file system to access |
|  |  |  |  | different content, you must |
|  |  |  |  | first create a share to the |
|  |  |  |  | root of the file system. Then, |
|  |  |  |  | you can connect from a |
|  |  |  |  | Windows host, create |
|  |  |  |  | additional directories from |
|  |  |  |  | Windows, and create |
|  |  |  |  | corresponding network |
|  |  |  |  | shares using the REST API, |
|  |  |  |  | Unisphere GUI, or |
|  |  |  |  | Unisphere CLI. |

### **dhsmServer**

Information about the ASA/DHSM server of a NAS server. You can configure one ASA/DHSM server per NAS server.

ASA stands for Advanced Storage Access. ASA allows VMware administrators to manage appropriately configured host configurations by taking advantage of advanced file operations that optimize NFS storage utilization. Once ASA is enabled on the NAS server, Dell's VSI Unified Storage Management tool can be utilized for the following:

- Simplifying the process of creating NFS datastores,
- Compressing virtual machines in NFS datastores,
- Reducing the amount of storage consumed by virtual machines by using data reduction and Fast Clone technologies. The cloning functions include fast clones (thin copy/snaps) of Virtual Machine Disk (VMDF) files and full clones (full copy) of Virtual Machine Disk (VMDF) files.

# **dnsServer**

Domain Name System (DNS) settings.

A Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system responsible for converting domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. The system uses DNS services to resolve network names and IP addresses for the network services it needs (for example, for NTP and SMTP servers), and to obtain IP addresses for hosts addressed by network names rather than IP addresses.

During the initial system configuration process you must specify the network address of at least one DNS server for resolving hostnames to IP addresses. Later, you can add, delete, or change DNS server settings.

You can configure multiple DNS server domains to specify each domain and IP address of the DNS servers for the system to use. By default, the system uses the top entry in the list as the current DNS server. The remaining list provides a hierarchy of DNS servers to use if the first-choice server becomes unavailable. If the first DNS server in the list becomes unavailable, the system proceeds to the next DNS server in the list, and so on. You can also specify default DNS server addresses to indicate which addresses the system will use first.

DNS server addresses are grouped under DNS server domains. Each domain is identified by a domain identifier.

**Important:** You must configure at least one valid DNS server entry in the domain for the system. Deleting the last DNS server entry can disrupt network communication to the device, and potentially interrupt communication between the system and the hosts that use its storage resources.

### **esrsParam**

Information about the EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS) configuration

Unity Remote Support is enabled with the Dell's leading remote support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote monitoring and support feature that provides authorized personnel with Dell remote access capabilities to storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage system and systems on the Dell network can be used to transfer files out to the storage system or back to Dell.

ESRS provides the following features in providing an end-to-end remote support solution:

- Automation IP based connection enables fast remote diagnosis and repair of potential problems before an impact to business operations is noticed.
- Authentication Advanced security features such as AES 256-bit encryption and RSA digital certificates ensure data privacy.
- Authorization Customizable policies that you control include the ability to allow or deny remote support sessions.
- Audit Detailed audit capabilities enable compliance with regulatory and internal business requirements.

ESRS offers two remote support solutions:

- Integrated solution, which uses ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) technology integrated into the storage system to connect with Dell
- Centralized solution, which uses the ESRS Virtual Edition (ESRS V3) to connect with Dell

Setting up Remote Support requires:

- An installed Dell Support license
- Valid support credentials
- A configured DNS server

For information about ESRS components and setup, go to the support website.

Note that all proxy configuration for integrated support is now available from the supportProxy object. These properties proxyIsEnabled,proxyStatus,proxyAddress,proxyIsHTTP,proxyUserName are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

#### **Examples**

}

}

}

{ }

{ }

{

#### **Series operations need** to **perform** to **enable Integrated Remote Support**

Step 1: Accept EULA. The EULA must be accepted before any other configurations. POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify {

Step 2: Update contact infomation in systemInformation object. Dell will use this information to contact enduser when errors detected.

POST /api/instances/systemInformation/0/action/modify

"isEsrsVeEulaAccepted" : "true"

{ "contactFirstName" : "Jill", "contactLastName" : "Valentine", "contactCompany" : "Umbrella Corporation", "contactEmail" : "jill.valentine@umbrella.com", "contactPhone" : "111-111-1111"

Step 3: Set proxy server if the user wants to configure Integrated Remote Support with a proxy server. This step can be skipped if user doesn't want to use proxy server.

POST /api/instances/supportProxy/0/action/modify {

"isEnabled" : "true", "address" : "10.105.221.123:1080", "protocol" : "1", "username" : "darthv", "password" : "password"

Step 4: Validate Network connectivity between Integrated Remote Support client and Dell servers.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/checkNetwork

Following steps are try to get the available sites for the current system, select the correct one and set it into Integrated Remote Support client. Step 5: Request for an access code. This access code will be used later to get the available sites.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/requestAccessCode

#### Step 6: Validate the access code.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/validateAccessCode

"accessCode" : "243857"

Step 7: Set siteId. Select the correct site id from the returned sites in previous request. POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify

"enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "false"

}

{

}

}

Now, Integration Remote Support is enabled.

#### **Disabling Integrated Remote Support**

"isCentralized" : "false"

If a proxy server or Policy Manager are enabled, they will automatically be disabled.

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify { "enabled" : "false",

# **Checking** the **Integrated Remote Support status**

# GET /api/types/esrsParam/instances?fields=enabled,isCentralized

"content": { "isCentralized" : "false", "status" : 2

}

# **Checking** the **Integrated Remote Support configuration**

GET /api/types/esrsParam/instances?fields=enabled,isCentralized,status, statusDescription::@enum(status)

Sample response:

"content":

}

{

}

{

}

*

{ "enabled" : "true",

"isCentralized" : "false",

"status" : "2"

"statusDescription" : "connected"

The statusDescription attribute is a calculated attribute that translates the normalized status value into a user friendly string.

### **Enabling Centralized Remote Support**

POST /api/instances/esrsParam/0/action/modify

"enabled" : "true", "isCentralized" : "true", "esrsVeAddress" : "10.105.221.123"

#### **esrsPolicyManager**

Information about the EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS) policy manager configuration

The storage system Remote Support is enabled with the Dell's leading remote support platform: EMC Secure Remote Support (ESRS). ESRS is a remote monitoring and support feature that provides authorized Dell remote access capabilities to the storage systems via a secure and encrypted tunnel. The secure tunnel that ESRS establishes between the storage system and systems on the Dell network can be used to transfer files out to the storage system or back to Dell.

ESRS policy manager is run on a dedicated server which allows customers to control remote sessions and define customized ESRS policy. **Examples**

System FAST VP settings. FAST VP allows performing automatic data relocation between tiers and rebalancing within a tier to improve storage performance. Currently there three types of relocations supported:

- Scheduled relocations
- Manual relocations
- Rebalancing

Scheduled relocations are started according the schedule defined in this resource. Individual pools can be included to or excluded from the scheduled relocation process. Manual relocations can be performed on demand for each particular pool.

Rebalancing is performed automatically on a pool extend event. The FAST VP object represents the status of scheduled relocation processes and allows to view or modify the scheduled relocation parameters. It also provides a means to pause or resume all the FAST VP relocation and rebalancing processes currently running on the system.

#### **Supported operations**

# **fileKerberosServer**

Information about the Kerberos service used by the storage system for secure connections. You can configure one Kerberos settings object per NAS server.

Kerberos is a distributed authentication service designed to provide strong authentication with secret-key cryptography. It works on the basis of "tickets" that allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity in a secure manner. When configured to act as a secure NFS server, the NAS server uses the RPCSEC_GSS security framework and Kerberos authentication protocol to verify users and services. You can configure a secure NFS environment for a multiprotocol NAS server or one that supports Unix-only shares. In this environment, user access to NFS file systems is granted based on Kerberos principal names.

| sizeAllocated | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Size of pool space allocated for the file system: |
|  |  | . For a thin-provisioned file system, this as a rule is |
|  |  | less than the value of the size Total attribute and slightly greater than or equal to the value of the |
|  |  | sizeUsed attribute. |
|  |  | . For a not thin-provisioned file system, this is approximately equal to the value of the attribute |

Fral-Safe Nework (FSN) is a high-availability teature bate extends link laliover into the network by providing a switch-level redundaror, An FSN appears as a single link wi FSN can be built from Ethernet Ports and non-FSN ink aggegations, or combination of them. Only one cornestion in an FSN is adive at a fine. Port uth addive connection is the avaliable. Port with prinar cannection is the Printer Port, II the primar cornection fails. Unive adornatically switches bone of the starthy connections. When the eximalisms back to the primary connection

Note: If you want to include either Ethernet Ports or link aggregations in an FSN Port, configure them before creating an FSN

Note: You can aggregate only Ethernet Ports and link aggregations with the same MTU size and not included in another FSN Port

Note: You can not add an Ethernet Port to FSN if there are iSCSI portals on it

The features of an ESN Port are as follows

- FSN component devices do not have to be the same device type. A single FSN Port can include Fast Ethenet devices or link aggregations, or a combination of these types, all o
- There can be a maximum of four devices in a FSN
- Only one component device of an FSN Port is active at a time
- If all the connections in FSN Port fail, the link is down
- The Unisphere online Help provides more details on FSN configuring

### **ftpServer**

Information about the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) servers of a NAS server.

You can configure one FTP server and one SFTP server per NAS server. File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet. For secure transmission that encrypts the username, password, and content, FTP is secured with SSH (SFTP).

You can activate an FTP server and SFTP server independently on each NAS server. The FTP and SFTP clients are authenticated using credentials defined on a Unix name server (such as an NIS server or a LDAP server) or a Windows domain. Windows user names need to be entered using the 'username@domain' or 'domain\\username' formats. Each FTP and SFTP must have a home directory defined in the name server that must be accessible on the NAS server. FTP allows also clients to connect as anonymous users.

Information about host initiators in the storage system.

After you create a host configuration for controlling host access to storage on the system, you need to create a host initiator for each host configuration that accesses iSCSI or Fibre Channel (FC) storage. The initiator connects the host to the target iSCSI or FC node on the system.

Initiator-based registration allows you to register the initiator to a host without having to manage individual paths. By default, when an initiator is registered to a host, all of its paths, including those specified after the registration takes place, are automatically granted access to any storage provisioned for the host.

## job

Information about the jobs in the storage system.

A job represents one management request, it consists of a series of tasks. A job could also contain a series of primitive REST API POST requests, each of which maps to a task in the job. Such job is known as \"batch request job\". Client can query the job instance to track its progress, results, and details of each task.

When a job is failed, the system might leave hehind unneeded resources that consume space. You can manually delete any resources that were created for the failed job.

### **ldapServer**

Information about the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server used by the storage system as an authentication authority for administrative users. You can configure one LDAP server. The system uses the LDAP settings for facilitating access control to Unisphere and the Unisphere CLI, but not for facilitating access control to storage resources.

LDAP is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running on TCP/IP networks. LDAP provides central management for network authentication and authorization operations by helping to centralize user and group management across the network. Integrating the system into an existing LDAP environment provides a way to control user and user group access to the system through Unisphere or the Unisphere CLI.

After you configure LDAP settings for the system, you can manage users and user groups within the context of an established LDAP directory structure. For example, you can assign access permissions to the Unisphere CLI that are based on existing users and groups.

## linkAggregation

(Applies if link aggregation is supported.) Ethernet port link aggregation settings.

 Link aggregation lels you link Elhenet ports (to example, port D and port 1) on a Single logical port, and therefore les you use up b four Ethernet ports on the SP. It your physical ports, the same ports on both SPs are linked for redundancy. For example, if you link port 0 to port 1, the system creates one link aggregation for these porks on

Note: You can aggregate only Ethernet ports belonging to the same VO module or on-board Ethemet ports. Aggregation of ports from different V/O modules is not allowed

Note: You can aggregate only Ethernet ports with the same MTU size

Note: You can not add an Ethernet port to aggregation if there are iSCSI portals on it.

Link aggregation provides the following advantages:

- Increases overall throughput, since two physical ports are linked into one logical port.
- Provides basic load balancing across linked ports, since the network traffic is distributed across multiple physical ports.
- Provides redundant ports so that if one port in a linked pair fails, the system does not lose connectivity.

**Note:** With link aggregation, both linked ports must be connected to the same switch, and the switch must be configured to use the link aggregation that uses the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP). The documentation that came with your switch should provide more information about using LACP.

The Unisphere online Help provides more details on cabling the SPs to the Disk-Array Enclosures (DAEs).

### **nasServer**

Information about the NAS server in the storage system.

NAS Servers are software components used to transfer data and provide the connection ports for hosts to access file-level storage resources. NAS servers are independent from each other.

NAS Servers access data on available drives making it available to network hosts via specific protocols (NFS/SMB/FTP/SFTP). Storage system supports NAS Servers for managing file-level storage resources, such as VMware NFS datastores or file systems.

Before you can provision a file-level storage resource, a NAS Server must be created with the necessary sharing protocols enabled. When NAS Servers are created, you can specify the storage pool and owning SP - either SPA or SPB.

In the storage systems, NAS Servers can leverage the Link Aggregation functionality to create a highly available environment. Once a link aggregated port group is available, you create or modify NAS Server network interfaces to leverage the available port group. Because NAS Servers are accessible through only one SP at a time, they will fail over to the other SP when there is an SP failure event.

|  |  | on the storage system. |
|  |  | Before you can create additional shares within an NFS |
|  |  | shared folder, you must create directories within it from a |

# ntpServer

Network Time Protocol (NTP) server settings

The system relies on NTP eas a stardard for synchronizing the system clock with other nodes on the network. NTP provides a way of synchronizing docks of distributed systems w Windows Active Directory domain controller can operate as a time server if the Windows Time Service is running on it

Some applications will not operate correctly if the oloxk on the systemis not synbronized with the ocock on comected hosts. Comigure the system and any comnected hosts bo use

- . Minimizes the chance that synchronization issues will arise between the system and connected hosts.
• Beduces the difficulty of reconciling timestamps used for log information in the different systems

Wole: When using a NAS server for CJFS network shares, the system cannot access an Active Directory donain unless the yslem is synchronized within five minutes of the Active network shares reside

You can configure a total of four NTP server addresses for the system. All NTP server addresses are grouped into a single NTP server record.

### **pool**

#### Information about pools in the storage system.

#### **Creating pools using Quick Start mode**

You can use Quick Start mode to create system recommended pools based on the type and availability of drives in the system. In Quick Start mode, the system recommends separate pools for different drive types and uses default RAID configurations for the drives. A pool configured in Quick Start mode has only one tier.

Quick Start mode is available when both of these conditions are met:

- No pools exist on the system.
- The system is not licensed for FAST VP or FAST Cache.

### To create pools using Quick Start mode, follow these steps:

- 1. Run POST api/types/pool/action/recommendAutoConfiguration.
#### The response body contains a set of poolSetting instances.

- 2. For each poolSetting instance returned in Step 1, run POST /api/types/pool/instances with the following arguments, using values obtained from the poolSetting instance:
	- addRaidGroupParameters : [{dskGroup : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.diskGroup,
	- numDisks : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.diskCount,
	- raidType : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.raidType,
	- stripeWidth : poolSetting.storageConfiguration.possibleStorageConfigurations.raidGroupConfigurations.stripeWidths},...]

Pool creation examples: Simple pool with one RAID5 4+1: POST /api/types/pool/instances {"name" : "PerformancePool", "addRaidGroupParameters" : [ {"dskGroup" : {"id" : dg_15}, "numDisks" : 6, "raidType" : 1, "stripeWidth" : 5} ] }

Pool with raid group RAID10 1+1: {"name" : "SysDefPool00", "description" : "The pool is created with RAID10(1+1)", "addRaidGroupParameters" : [ {"dskGroup" : {"id" : "dg_16"}, "numDisks" : 5, "raidType" : 7, "stripeWidth" : 2} ]

#### **Embedded resource types**

poolConsumer class is representation of single object that consumes storage inside pools. There are two types of pool consumers: storage resources and NAS servers. NAS servers and storage resource except Consistency groups are always wholly allocated in one and only one storage pool. Consistency group can be allocated in more than one storage pool in case if the LUNs belonging to the group allocated in the different pools. The NAS servers consume space in the pool of constant size which is not changed once NAS server created.

## **preferredInterfaceSettings**

The preferred interface of NAS server is an interface from which all the non-local outbound connections of this NAS server are initiated. The non-local connections are those which hosts can be accessed from this NAS server interfaces only via some router (gateway).

The preferred interfaces for IPv4 and IPv6 are independent from each other. During the replication, the production interfaces could be activated and deactivated automatically, so the separate preferred interface settings are required for production and backup & DR testing interfaces. For each NAS server, the following preferred interface settings exist:

- 1. Production interfaces, IPv4.
- 2. Production interfaces, IPv6.
- 3. Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv4.
- 4. Backup & DR testing interfaces, IPv6.

Each of these settings could be set to the explicit interface. If it isn't set, corresponding interface will be selected automatically.

The acting preferred interfaces, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6, are selected among active interfaces by the following rules, ordered by priority (highest first):

- 1. Manually selected interfaces have priority over automatically selected ones.
- 2. Production interfaces have priority over backup and DR testing ones.
- 3. The interface with the default gateway has priority over one not having one.
- 4. From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the most routes has the priority.
- 5. From the otherwise equal priority interfaces, one with the minimal value of IP address (Sic!) has the priority.

**Note:** During the replication, on the destination side, only Backup & DR testing interfaces could be active.

For the automatic selection, the interface re-selected each time any of this NAS interfaces or routes are changed. If the interface has been explicitly selected as preferred and then deleted, this type/class group setting (e.g. "Production/IPv6") gets reset to automatic selection.

During the replication, on the destination side, only the production interfaces settings could be overridden. It is controlled by the single flag both for IPv4 and IPv6 interfaces. Note that this flag is independent from the "override" flag of the interface itself. If an interface is explicitly selected as preferred and then overridden, the interface is kept preferred.

The acting preferred interfaces are marked by the corresponding property value, fileInterface.isPreferred == true. To get the list of the acting preferred interfaces of a NAS server, iterate its interface list checking the isPreferred property.

# **replicationSession**

Information about replication sessions.

Replication is a process in which storage data is duplicated either locally or to a remote network device. Replication produces a read-only, point-in-time copy of source data and periodically updates the copy, keeping it consistent with the source data. Replication provides an enhanced level of redundancy in case the main storage backup system fails. As a result, the:

Downtime associated cost of a system failure is minimized.

Recovery process from a natural or human-caused disaster is facilitated.

A replication session establishes an end-to-end path for a replication operation between a source and a destination. The replication source and destination may be local or remote. The session establishes the path that the data follows as it moves from source to destination.

## **Delete operation**

Delete a replication session. This can be applied in any operational state of the session.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | DELETE /api/instances/replicationSession/<id> |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance to delete. |

#### **Precheck operation**

Precheck the replication session. Check for a common base snap of a sync replication session, and if it is a NAS Server session, also check each includedfilesystem replication session for a common base snap. A common base snap is identified by the corresponding source and destination snap ids for the replicated common base snap. The result will include each common base snap found, which may be an empty list.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/precheck |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| precheckOutput | out | List<commonBaseSnap> | N/A | The result of the precheck. |

#### **Resume operation**

Resume a replication session. This can be applied on a replication session when it's operational status is reported as either Failed over or Paused. The allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy option is needed when a replication session goes out of sync due to a fault. Both allowFullCopy and forceFullCopy cannot be set simultaneously. If the session has no common base snapshot and neither allowFullCopy nor forceFullCopy is specified, a full copy will be performed using the same behavior as when allowFullCopy is set to true for a synchronous file replication. For NAS Server synchronous replication, if allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy is specified as false, the operation will fail since NAS Server synchronous replication has never had a common base snapshot.

|  |  |  |  | from the source to the destination during the |
|  |  |  |  | replication session resuming. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Replicate all data. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Replicate changed data only. |
| forceDiscardDestinationChanges | in | Boolean | Optional | Normally an asynchronous replication |
|  |  |  |  | session cannot be resumed when the |
|  |  |  |  | destination is or has been mounted R/W and |
|  |  |  |  | may have data written locally. The |
|  |  |  |  | forceDiscardDestinationChanges option |
|  |  |  |  | allows resume to proceed. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Resync the destination from the |
|  |  |  |  | source, overwriting any data written to |
|  |  |  |  | the destination while the replication was |
|  |  |  |  | not active. |
|  |  |  |  | false - The resume command will fail if |
|  |  |  |  | the destination is R/W and may have |
|  |  |  |  | data written locally. |

#### **Pause operation**

Pause a replication session. This can be applied to replication session when in OK state.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/pause |
|  | where <id> is the unique identifier of the replicationSession instance. |
|  | Or |
|  | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/name:<value>/action/pause |
|  | where <value> is the name of the replicationSession instance. |
| Request body arguments | None |
| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

#### **Sync operation**

Sync a replication session. This operation can be applied to initiate a sync on demand independent of type of session - auto or manual sync.

| Header | Accept: application/json |
| --- | --- |
|  | Content-Type: application/json |
| Method and URI | POST /api/instances/replicationSession/<id>/action/sync |

| Request body arguments | None |
| Successful return status | 204 No Content, 202 Accepted (async response) |
| Successful response body | No body content. |

#### **Failover operation**

Fail over a replication session. Note that if a failover occurs and data is written to the new source (original destination), new snaps are taken, and finally a failback occurs: then those snaps will get replicated to the new destination (original source). However, we maintain the local retention for the original source and the remote retention for the original destination. If the same scenario occurs but a resume is requested instead of failback (essentially switching the

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | out |  |  |  |
| sync | in | Boolean | Optional | Indicates whether to sync the source and destination resources before |
|  |  |  |  | failing over the asynchronous replication session or whether to keep them |
|  |  |  |  | in sync after failing over the synchronous replication session. |
|  |  |  |  | true - Sync before failing over the asynchronous replication session or |
|  |  |  |  | keep in sync after failing over the synchronous replication session. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Do not sync before failing over the asynchronous replication |
|  |  |  |  | session or do not keep in sync after failing over the synchronous |
|  |  |  |  | replication session. |

|  |  |  |  | server when a replication failover is issued from the source NAS server. |
|  |  |  |  | true - skip pre-check. |
|  |  |  |  | false - Do not skip pre-check. |

**Failback operation**

Fail back a replication session. This can be applied on a replication session that is failed over. Fail back will synchronize the changes done to the original destination back to original source site and will restore the original direction of session. The allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy option is needed when a replication session goes out of sync due to a fault. Both allowFullCopy and forceFullCopy cannot be set simultaneously. If the session has no common base snapshot and neither allowFullCopy nor forceFullCopy is specified, a full copy will be performed using the same behavior as when allowFullCopy is set to true for a synchronous file replication. For NAS Server synchronous replication, if allowFullCopy or forceFullCopy is specified as false, the operation will fail since NAS Server synchronous replication has never had a common base snapshot.

### **Preserve_async operation**

Preserve an async replication session. Preserve an async replication session associated with original source of this nas server/filesystem sync replication session after a failover. Preserve recreates one prior async replication from the original source. Preserve tries to find the prior async session on the destination remote system identified by the remoteSystem parameter, and if successful, removes the existing session, creates a new async session to the remote system, and starts the replication process. If there is a common base snap available, then that will be used to optimize the initial copy. Preserve requires that the original async sessions are in the hibernated state. It also requires that there is not already an async replication from the local nas_server to the remote system.

### **route**

Manages static IP routes, including creating, modifying, and deleting these routes.

A route determines where to send a packet next so it can reach its final destination. A static route is set explicitly and does not automatically adapt to the changing network infrastructure. A route is defined by an interface, destination IP address range and an IP address of a corresponding gateway.

**Note:** IP routes connect an interface (IP address) to the larger network through gateways. Without routes, the interface is no longer accessible outside of its immediate subnet. As a result, network shares and exports associated with the interface are no longer available to clients outside their immediate subnet.

Routes can be created only for iSCSI portals.

#### **rpChapSettings**

CHAP accounts management for RPA cluster. RPA iSCSI ports act as initiators and log into storage targets, meanwhile, storage iSCSI ports act as initiators and log into RPA targets as well. For security reason, forward CHAP is supported on both directions. Outgoing forward CHAP account is used by storage ports to log into RPAs and incoming foward CHAP account is used by storage to authenticate RPA initiators. However, for now incoming forward account is managed by iscsiSettings and it will be moved here in later releases.

# securitySettings

All the system level security settings Use this resource to enable and disable system level security settings The settings include

### a) FIPS 140-2

Information about whether the system is working in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 mode.

The storage systems support FIPS 140-2 mode for the RSA BSAFE SSL modules on the storage pocessor that handle client management traffic. Management communication into and out of the system is encrypted using SSL. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a cipher suite to use in the exchange. The use of FIPS 140-2 mode restricts the allowable set of cipher suites that can be selected in the negotiation to those that are sufficiently strong.

If FIPS 140-2 mode is enabled, you may find that some of your existing clients can no longer communicate with the management ports of the array if they do not support a cipher suite of acceptable strength.

#### b) SSO

Information about whether the system is participating in Single Sign On mode.

In Single Sign On (SSO) mode, Unisphere Central (UC) becomes the authentication server for multiple storage system, thus creating a shared authentication domain where cross-array operations can be performed without re-entering user credentials.

If SSO is enabled, the system will participate in Single Sign On mode, and authenticate against Unisphere Central previously configured on this array.

#### c) TLS Mode

Information about which TLS protocol versions the Storage Management Server allows for TLS communication.

Management communication into and out of the Storage Management Server is encrypted using TLS. As a part of this process, the client and the Storage Management Server negotiate a TLS protocol version to use. By default, the Storage Management Server supports TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols for TLS communications. TLS Mode tls1_0 means that the Storage Management Server will support TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols. TLS Mode tls1_1 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols and TLSv1.0 will not be considered a valid protocol. TLS Mode tls1_2 means that the Storage Management Server will only support TLS communications using the TLSv1.2 protocol. TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 will not be considered valid protocols.

Disabling TLSv1.0 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols. Similarly, disabling TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 may impact existing client applications which are not compatible with TLSv1.2 protocol. In these cases, TLSv1.0 and/or TLSv1.1 support should remain enabled. Please refer to the security configuration guide for backward compatibility.

NOTE: The modification of the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server is handled separately. Please use the svc_nas service script to configure the supported TLS protocol versions for the NAS server.

Create an ugrade session b upgrade the system software or view existing uggade sessions. The ugrade session installs an ugrade candidate ile that was upbaded b the system. D Online Support website. Use the CLI to upload the upgrade candidate to the system before creating the upgrade session. For information, see the Unisphere CLU User Guide.

The latest software upgrade candidate contains all available hot fixes. If you have applied hot fixes to your system, the hot fixes are included in the latest upgrade candid

Note: All system components must be healthy prior to upgrading the system software. If any system components are degraded, the software update will fail.

## **storageResource**

Information about storage resources in the storage system.

A storage resource is a specific type of storage entity allocated in the storage system for a particular kind of host or application. The storage system provides the following types of storage resources:

- LUNs
- Consistency groups
- File systems accessed via NFS and/or CIFS shares.
- VMware NFS datastores
- VMware VMFS datastores
- VVol (file)
- VVol (block)
- All types of storage resource types can be divided into two major groups:
- Block (or LUN based) storage resources: LUNs, consistency groups, VMware VMFS datastores, VVol (block).
- File system based storage resources: File systems, VMware NFS datastores, VVol (file).

In order to create a storage resource, there must be at least one pool configured on the system. For information about configuring pools, see the help topic for the pool. To provision file system based storage resource there must be at least one nasServer configured on the system.

#### Arguments for the Modify operation

| Arqument | In/ | Type | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | out |  |  |  |
| name | in | String | Optional | System name. |
| uuidBase | in | unsigned | Optional | Base value used to generate UUIDs in the host |

|  |  |  |  | This attribute is required by the GUI to display the |
|  |  |  |  | upgrade details window on the first login after the |
|  |  |  |  | upgrade completes. It does not depend on the |
|  |  |  |  | session. The user who started an upgrade may not |
|  |  |  |  | see its results, if another user logged in earlier. |
| isEulaAccepted | in | Boolean | Optional | Indicates whether to accept the End User License |
|  |  |  |  | Agreement (EULA) for an upgrade. Once the EULA |
|  |  |  |  | is accepted, users can upload product licenses and |
|  |  |  |  | configure the system, or both. Values are: |
|  |  |  |  | . true - Accept the EULA .. |
|  |  |  |  | . false - Do not accept the EULA. |

Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id | String | Unique identifier of the systemCapacity instance. |
| sizeFree | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Amount of free space available in the pools on the storage |
|  |  | system. |
| sizeTotal | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Total amount of space in the pools on the storage system, |
|  |  | which will be the sum of sizeFree, sizeUsed and |
|  |  | sizePreallocated space. |
| sizeUsed | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Amount of used space in the pools on the storage system. |
| sizePreallocated | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Space reserved form the pools on the storage system. |
|  |  | These space is for future needs to make writes more |
|  |  | efficient. pools may be able to reclaim some of this if space |
|  |  | is running low. |
| dataReductionSizeSaved | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Amount of space saved by data reduction (includes savings |
|  |  | from compression, deduplication and advanced |
|  |  | deduplication) in the pools on the storage system. |
| dataReductionPercent | unsigned Integer[32(percent)] | Data reduction applied increase of storage space expressed |
|  |  | as percentage of summary of used and data reduction saved |
|  |  | space size (includes space saved from compression and |
|  |  | deduplication). |
| dataReductionRatio | Float[64] | Storage efficiency ratio of applying data reduction on the |
|  |  | system, calculated according to the data reduction savings |
|  |  | (includes savings from compression and deduplication) for |
|  |  | each block and file object (LUN/Filesystem/datastore) and its |
|  |  | snapshots, thus demonstrating the efficiency of data |
|  |  | reduction. |

| sizeSubscribed | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Size of space requested by the storage resources allocated |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | in all pools for possible future allocations. If this value is |
|  |  | greater than the total size, it means pools are |
|  |  | oversubscribed. |
| totalLogicalSize | unsigned Integer[64(bytes)] | Total logical provisioned capacity of primary storage objects |
|  |  | visible to hosts (as defined by the "size" attribute for each |
|  |  | primary storage objects), plus the total logical provisioned |
|  |  | capacity of all Snapshots (that is, the total capacity that |
|  |  | would be required if every snapshot were a fully provisioned |
|  |  | copy instead). |
| thinSavingsRatio | Float[64] | Storage efficiency ratio of thin provisioned primary storage |
|  |  | resources on the system, which demonstrates the efficiency |
|  |  | of thin provisioning. This is calculated as follows: (Total |
|  |  | provisioned size of all primary storage resources) / (Total |
|  |  | allocated size of all primary storage resources without |
|  |  | including data reduction savings, if any). Because savings |
|  |  | due to thin provisioning are virtual savings, this could exceed |
|  |  | the total system capacity. This does not include data |
|  |  | reduction savings or snapshot savings. |
| snapsSavingsRatio | Float[64] | Storage efficiency ratio of snapshots on the system, |
|  |  | calculated based on the capacity that would have been |
|  |  | required for fully provisioned copies, which demonstrates the |
|  |  | efficiency of snapshots. This is calculated as follows: (Total |
|  |  | snapshot size of all snapshots as if they were full copies) / |
|  |  | (Total allocated size of all snapshots without including data |
|  |  | reduction savings, if any). This does not include data |
|  |  | reduction savings or thin provisioning savings. |
| overallEfficiencyRatio | Float[64] | System-level storage efficiency ratio, calculated by dividing |
|  |  | the total logical capacity of the System by the actual Used |
|  |  | capacity on the System, This leverages the efficiency |
|  |  | features of thin provisioning, snapshots and data |
|  |  | reduction(compression and deduplication). |
| tiers | List < systemTierCapacity> | Size information (total, free, used) per tier. |

### tenant

 A tenant is a representation of a databaenter client, who uses an intelependent network structure and eds the indepent and exclusive access to certain storage essuvoses. On with an independent IP addressing. At the nonent, iSCSI and management resources do not supportmulit-tenant access. For each terant a corresponding Linux network namespae is belween the tenants is done by the VLANs. Each tenant reserves a group of VLANs, and each VLAV can belong bo one tenant maximum. Every tenant gels a name and the Universaly U channed during the league (ifle ovche. The asynchronous realitiation of the NAS severs is allewed only beleveen the servers belonging to the tarants with the same UUQ. The N NAS serves and VLANs operate in the Linux base network namespace, together with management and GSS interfases. The control stack of the system does not allow user to log in NAS servers and VLANs are managed from the single system administrator account. To allow this, the corresponding GUl and CLI modifications are made
